<p>Gentlemen! The disease which we intend to study to-day is
one, the traces of which are found much oftener at post-mortems
than the disease itself in the clinic. A great many cases are
overlooked and improperly diagnosed for reasons which I shall
state hereafter.</p>

<p>It has been called by various names. Round ulcer, perforating
ulcer, chronic ulcer, corroding ulcer and simple ulcer are
only different designations for one and the same condition. I
prefer to call it <i>peptic ulcer</i>, as it is always the result of self-digestion
of a part of the walls of the stomach, but is not always
round, nor perforating, nor chronic, nor corroded; nor is it always
simple, several ulcers having occasionally been found in one
and the same stomach.</p>

<p>Pathologists have not yet come to a positive decision on the
<i>modus operandi</i> of its origin, but several conditions are mentioned
as necessary for its development.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">« 146 »</a></span></p>

<p>1. The self-digestion of a part of the stomach by the gastric
juice.</p>

<p>2. Disturbances of the circulation of the blood in the walls
of the stomach.</p>

<p>3. The alkalinity of the blood circulating in the walls of the
stomach prevents the digestion of the mucous membrane. If
this action on the walls of the stomach is prevented in any way,
the development of an ulcer is aided. This clause has been
accepted until recently, when it has been rendered somewhat
doubtful by the results of certain experiments.</p>

<p>The first clause is sustained by the fact that the peptic ulcer
is only found in those parts which are brought into direct contact
with the gastric juice. It is further proven by the softening
of the stomach so frequently found at post-mortem. But as
long as the circulation of the blood in the walls of the stomach
is normal, ulcers do not form. The formation of an ulcer in the
stomach presupposes a local disturbance of the circulation. It
is usual to find thrombi and diseases of the bloodvessels in cases
where ulcers of the stomach occur. For this reason the latter
is more common in anaemic persons where the circulation is
retarded and the bloodvessels frequently subject to fatty degeneration.</p>

<p>Virchow regards embolism of a small vessel as the origin of
ulcer of the stomach. Cohnheim disproved this beyond doubt
by showing that there is an abundant circulation in the walls of
the stomach by which the parts affected are again quickly supplied
with blood. Klebs takes for granted a spasmodic contraction
of single bloodvessels as the cause of the retardation of
the circulation, while Rindfleich attributes it to the poor anastomotic
connection of the gastric veins. He calls attention to
the frequent coincidence of ulcer and hemorrhagic infarct in the
walls of the stomach. Cohnheim injected chromate of lead into
the gastric branch of the splenic artery in animals, and when
he succeeded in cutting off the arterial supply of the mucous
and submucous layers <i>only</i>, he found as a result large ulcers with
sharp, well-defined margins and a circular base. If the animals
were examined in the second week after the experiment, they
showed several small ulcers in place of the larger one. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">« 147 »</a></span>
third week the ulcers were found to have healed. From these
experiments you can see that the gastric ulcer has a natural tendency
to heal when not interfered with. By experiments such
as these it has been proven beyond doubt that disturbances of
circulation of a small part of the stomach may lead to ulcer.
But the causes of these disturbances, and the reasons why some
ulcers do not heal, are still disputed questions.</p>

<p>Pavy claims that the alkalinity of the blood prevents the gastric
juice from acting on the walls of the stomach. When he
introduced acids into the stomach and allowed the circulation
of the blood to continue, no ulcers resulted; if he impeded the
circulation, the stomach was digested by its acid contents.
Samelson instituted experiments to test the statement of Pavy.
He introduced large quantities of various acids into the stomach
of his animals without observing ulceration as a result; he also
neutralized the blood by the injection of weakened acids into
the bloodvessels, but no ulceration followed. But he did not
impede the gastric circulation in his experiments, while Pavy
did, hence the difference in their results. Clinical experience,
however, favors Pavy's views. We can prevent the further progress
of the gastric ulcer by the use of alkalies, while acids only
favor its growth. These questions still need additional research
before they are definitely solved.</p>

<p>Gastric ulcer may occur in any part of the digestive tract
which is exposed to the action of the gastric juice; hence it is
found in the lower part of the &#339;sophagus, any part of the
stomach and the upper part of the duodenum. It is found most
frequently in the pyloric end of the stomach, because this part
is most frequently subjected to mechanical irritation and to the
action of the gastric juice.</p>

<p>The shape of the ulcer is usually conical or terraced, its diameter
being largest in the mucous membrane and smallest at
its base, in the deeper structures.</p>

<p>The gastric ulcer must be very common. In about five per
cent of all cadavers we find ulcers in the stomach or else scars
as traces of former ulceration. Ulcer of the stomach is frequently
passed over without recognition, because most physicians
do not decide upon this diagnosis, unless hæmatemesis
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">« 148 »</a></span>
occurs. Gastric hemorrhage, however, is not necessarily a concomitant
feature of every gastric ulcer, and the hemorrhage
may occur without vomiting, the blood being either digested
and absorbed or passing on into the bowel and causing dark
stools. Thus occasionally the only symptom of hemorrhage of
the stomach is the appearance of darker stools, a symptom of
doubtful value when taken alone, but of some importance when
in connection with others.</p>

<p>A few years ago an elderly lady was admitted into the hospital
on account of severe pain in the stomach and the appearance
of dark stools. While in the hospital vomiting of blood
set in, continuing three days, and then the patient died. At
the post-mortem we found that an ulcer of the stomach had
burrowed through the diaphragm and pericardium into the wall
of the left ventricle, perforating finally with a small opening into
the left ventricle. I can only explain the length of the time
between perforation and death (three days) by assuming that
part of the gastric fistula leading through the walls of the heart
was firmly closed during systole, and only allowed a small quantity
of blood to ooze through during each diastole.</p>

<p><i>Symptomatology.</i> If you were to rely upon the occurrence of gastric
hemorrhage in making your diagnosis, a great many blunders
would necessarily occur, as this symptom is present in but one
quarter of all the cases. I can give you an exact picture of
the symptoms from experience on myself, having repeatedly been
a sufferer from gastric ulcer and having studied every phase of
the question carefully upon myself, frequently experimenting to
get at various truths.</p>

<p>One of the most important and characteristic symptoms is the
<i>localized pain or soreness</i> which is felt in a small, well defined
area, and either originates or is increased by chemical or mechanical
irritation. This spot always was sensitive both to
warm and cold food. Salty food, alcoholic or sour articles
brought on pain. I could feel when the food passed the spot.
It was always more sensitive about an hour or two after a meal,
when the process of digestion was most active. My ulcer was
on the anterior wall of the stomach, so that I could greatly ease
the pain after meals by lying upon my back, while lying upon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">« 149 »</a></span>
the abdomen greatly aggravated it, as the food then came in contact
with the ulcer. I was a student yet when first suffering
from this trouble, and was treated by one of our prominent professors
for heart disease. He even gave me a certificate stating
that I was suffering from beginning hypertrophy of the left
ventricle. I was not improving under this treatment, and was
taken one day with violent pain in the stomach, followed by
vomiting of a large quantity of blood. Now the state of things
was cleared up, and under the proper treatment (for ulcer of
the stomach) I soon regained my health. I remained well for
a long time, but in the course of the last twenty years have
passed through several relapses. One of these, I distinctly remember,
occurred while I was making a tour through the Alps.
I had walked quite a distance that day and being very thirsty
drank three glasses of water in quick succession. I immediately
felt a pain in the stomach, and could distinctly feel how
one of the old scars was again rent asunder.</p>

<p>During these repeated attacks I found that the painful sensation
was really divisible into three distinct periods, that of constant
increase, during which the ulcer is developing and extending,
that of remaining at one height, and that of gradual decrease
during the period of healing. I could distinctly tell from
these various changes how my ulcer was getting along.</p>

<p>Two different kinds of pain are felt, the one constant and the
other occasional. The <i>constant pain</i> is usually present where
the ulcer has extended deeper into the tissues or when the surrounding
tissues are implicated. This pain is increased during
digestion or when pressure is made on the parts from without.
The <i>occasional pains</i> are either of a dyspeptic type, caused by the
catarrh which usually accompanies the ulcer, or of a cardialgic
(neuralgic) type, the result of irritation of the exposed nerve-endings
with the ulcer. These cardialgias are acute attacks of
very severe, excruciating pain, which occur during or between
the periods of digestion and are felt in the epigastrium and back
mostly, but sometimes radiate over the entire abdomen, into
the chest and even into the limbs. These attacks differ in no
respect from those occurring in some diseases of the gall bladder,
kidneys, peritoneum or uterus, and are consequently not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">« 150 »</a></span>
characteristic of gastric ulcer. The dyspeptic pain partakes
more of the character of feeling of fullness, a sense of oppression
in the epigastrium, heartburn, etc., such sensations as occur
in catarrh of the stomach and are felt during digestion.</p>

<p><i>The characteristic pain in ulcer of the stomach is a localized feeling
of soreness.</i> It is not always prominent. Chemical or mechanical
irritation of the ulcer brings it on, or if already present,
aggravates it. Especially acids, both mineral and vegetable, have
this effect, while alkalies allay it. This pain only occurs during
the process of digestion, when the food or gastric juice comes in
contact with the ulcer, or when the stomach is distended with
gas, and tension exerted on the tender spot. During the periods
when the stomach is at rest it does not occur.</p>

<p><i>Vomiting</i> occurs in about three-fourths of all cases of gastric
ulcer; vomiting of blood, however, only in about a quarter of
all the cases. The latter occurs oftener where the ulcer is
deep. In cases where the stomach is dilated, the amount vomited
may be enormous, and contain food which has been retained
in the dilated portion for several days.</p>

<p>As a result, also, of the accompanying catarrh of the stomach
and the consequent diminished absorption of fluids, we find
<i>constipation</i> and <i>diminished secretion of urine</i> in cases of ulcer of
the stomach.</p>

<p>Perforation of the stomach is most frequently caused by
gastric ulcer, and may be said to be a characteristic symptom;
but it usually occurs too late to be made use of in the treatment
of the ulcer. It is occasionally the first symptom which
calls the patient's attention to the fact that his stomach is and
has been seriously diseased. By the agglutinations of the base
of the ulcer with neighboring organs, through inflammatory
processes, perforation can take place into these organs. The
most frequent forms of perforation under such conditions are
those into the liver, spleen or pancreas, but cases have occurred
where perforation into the colon or pleural cavity has taken
place, or even into the pericardium, the heart or lungs. Some
time ago I saw a case of gangrene of the lung, the result of the
perforation of a gastric ulcer into this organ.</p>

<p>A few days ago I saw an interesting case, where an acute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">« 151 »</a></span>
gastritis culminated in the vomiting of a large quantity of pus.
The patient had been having high fever for a few days, with
incessant vomiting and great tenderness in the epigastrium.
Evidently an abscess had formed in the neighborhood of the
stomach, and finally opened into this organ, with the given
result.</p>

<p><i>Diagnosis.</i> There are two classes of characteristic symptoms&mdash;those
originating from the exposure of nerve-endings, and
those caused by ulceration into bloodvessels. The first class
includes the painful sensations, the characteristic soreness, which
occurs in about four-fifths of all the cases; the second class, the
hemorrhages, occurring in only one-fourth of all the cases.
You can readily see why pain occurs more often than hemorrhage.
Even a very superficial abrasion may expose nerve-endings
to the irritation of the food, while it takes a deeper
ulceration to lay open a larger bloodvessel. In order to make
a positive diagnosis, these two symptoms should be present.</p>

<p>Vomiting of blood alone need not necessarily be caused by
a gastric ulcer. There are a great many other conditions which
may cause it. It should, however, put you on the guard, and
can, in a great many cases, justify a diagnosis of probable ulcer
of the stomach.</p>

<p>The localized pain occurs, according to my experience, only
in cases of ulceration of the stomach; that is, in gastric or
peptic ulcer and in cancer of this organ. In order to differentiate
between these conditions, it becomes necessary to observe
whether the patient is cachectic or emaciated or not, and
whether a tumor can be felt in the region of the stomach. But
even these symptoms can be deceptive, as an abnormal hardness
or resistance&mdash;the result of perigastritic infiltration&mdash;may
occur in cases of simple ulcer, making the diagnosis almost
impossible. This is true especially in cases of ulcer of the
pyloric regions, while ulcers of the anterior wall of the stomach
are rarely accompanied by such infiltrations.</p>

<p>The pylorus is the most sensitive part of the stomach, and
frequently the seat of pain, when no lesion can be detected
post-mortem. The other parts of the stomach only become
painful when attacked by ulcerative or other pathological processes.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">« 152 »</a></span>
Another point worthy of consideration is that all forms
of pain in the stomach are usually referred to the pyloric region
by the patient, even if they originate in other parts.</p>

<p>From all this you can see that no positive diagnosis can be
made where any one of these symptoms is presented unaccompanied
by the others. A careful consideration of the symptoms
present will frequently, however, be of aid in making a
diagnosis. Intelligent patients will tell you that they have a
feeling of oppression, a feeling of distress in dyspepsia, but
will describe their feeling as that of distinct pain in ulcer. Pure
neuralgic pain is not always localized, but radiates into distant
parts, is not constant, but sets in all at once and disappears
with equal celerity, sometimes intermitting for days and weeks,
and then again setting in on the slightest nervous excitement.
Such pain is not aggravated by local pressure, shows no relation
to the digestive functions, does not depend upon the quality
or quantity of food taken, and may as well occur during a
fast as during a feast. Often such patients will tell you that
their pain does not cease until they have taken a hearty meal.</p>

<p>In cases of peptic ulcer, you will find that the pain is in
direct relation to the amount and quality of food taken; that
the patient has little or no pain when the stomach is at rest;
that coarse foods as well as acids cause or aggravate the pain,
and that indifferent foods, such as milk, do not bring it about,
though they may sometimes cause a sense of fullness or oppression.
Some patients with ulcer will tell you that the position
of their body has an influence on their pain. If they are so
placed that the food, by its gravity, lies on the ulcer, the pain
is brought on or increased, while if the patient under such circumstances
then changes his position, he is relieved of his pain
partially, or even entirely. Yes, some such patients must
assume abnormal positions while their stomach is active, in
order to avoid this suffering. Some patients with gastric ulcer
cannot digest <i>any</i> food without great pain, and frequently live
on a very scanty diet, rather than risk taking more food and
enduring these excruciating pains again.</p>

<p><i>Anomalous Cases.</i> Occasionally cases will occur in which the
symptoms presented do not justify the diagnosis of ulcer of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">« 153 »</a></span>
the stomach, only those of dyspepsia or else of gastric catarrh
being present, while we are still compelled to assume the diagnosis
of ulcer from the result of the treatment. Such cases
resist all kinds of treatment based upon the diagnosis of dyspepsia
or catarrh, and can only be cured by a strict "ulcer
cure."</p>

<p>Another class of cases only presents gastralgic pain without
any other symptom. Such are frequently patients who have
had gastric ulcer before. Others will come to you with intercostal
neuralgia on the left side. They have, perhaps, tried all
the usual anti-neuralgic remedies, have gone through a course
of treatment by electricity, and spent a large amount of time
and money, without obtaining permanent relief, until some
physician puts them on a strict milk diet and cures them in
this way in a short time.</p>

<p>Some cases of ulcer of the stomach present the queerest
symptoms. For instance: they complain of pain after drinking
milk, or even after taking a morphine powder, while they can
eat the coarsest food without any harm. Others run along
without presenting any symptoms at all, until they, as well as
their physicians, are surprised by the perforation of a gastric
ulcer.</p>

<p>All these abnormal cases, which form about one-fifth of all
the cases occurring, are so indistinct that they frequently
remain unrecognized throughout their entire course, and baffle
the skill of the best diagnosticians.</p>

<p>In order to be able to make a sure diagnosis, there must be
a localized pain, together with tenderness on pressure from
without on the painful spot. A great many persons in good
health are tender in the epigastrium, so that you have to be on
your guard in this direction, too. From the occurrence of
hæmatemesis in an otherwise healthy person you can, with
great probability, diagnose ulcer of the stomach.</p>

<p><i>Differential Diagnosis.</i> In order to differentiate <i>between catarrh
and ulcer</i>, it is simply necessary to keep in mind the difference
in the character of the pain, the fact that local pressure is more
liable to aggravate the pain in ulcer than in catarrh, and the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">« 154 »</a></span>
occurrence of hemorrhage in the former. The two conditions,
however, frequently occur in the same patient.</p>

<p>The differentiation between <i>ulcer and neurosis</i> has already been
discussed. The direct connection of the attacks of pain with
the introduction of food, and the character of the pain will soon
clear up the matter. Should you still be in doubt, a course of
treatment, such as an ulcer would demand, will soon clear up
the matter. If the case is one of ulcer, it will have been cured
or materially benefited, if it was a pure neurosis the patient
will if anything feel worse than before.</p>

<p>By far the most difficult question to decide in making a diagnosis
is whether the case is one of <i>ulcer or cancer</i> of the
stomach. Here close attention to several points will usually
clear up the diagnosis. Cancer sufferers always have a sallow
complexion, a worn, emaciated, cachectic appearance, no matter
what or how much they eat. Ulcer patients frequently have
a robust, healthy appearance, and are emaciated or run down
only after repeated hemorrhages, or when other grave diseases,
such as heart disease, chlorosis, tuberculosis, etc., are also
present.</p>

<p>The <i>presence or absence of a tumor</i> is a very important aid to
the diagnosis, though as I have already stated, not always reliable.
Sometimes an ulcer may be covered with granulations,
and its surroundings so infiltrated and hardened, that even post-mortem
the naked eye can not tell whether it is cancer or
simple ulcer, and the question has to be decided by microscope.
Such are likely the cases which form the bases of cancer cures
which are reported from time to time to have been effected by
the use of various remedies.</p>

<p><i>Vomiting of blood</i> is a symptom common to both cancer and
ulcer of the stomach, but is usually more copious in the latter.
If the absence of acid in the gastric juice of cancerous stomachs
proves to be as reliable a symptom as has been recently asserted,
this will be an important feature in the differentiation
from ulcer.</p>

<p>You will frequently be astonished by the success of your
treatment if you think of ulcer in doubtful cases of stomach
trouble, such as occurs in young girls with chlorosis and institute
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">« 155 »</a></span>
a strict milk diet with the measures adopted for the cure of
ulcer.</p>

<p><i>Prognosis.</i> From what has been said you can see that in
general the prognosis of ulcer of the stomach is good, that with
proper avoidance of all irritation, the ulcer has a tendency to
heal of itself. This tendency has been observed even in large
ulcers, where death was perhaps the result of some intercurrent
disease.</p>

<p>Ulcers of the anterior wall of the stomach are more dangerous
than such as occur on the posterior wall, for the reason that in
the latter case adhesion with the neighboring structures are
more easily formed, and thus fatal perforation prevented. The
anterior wall takes a much more active part in the peristaltic
movement of the stomach, and as a result does not enter so
easily into adhesion with its surroundings. Even after an ulcer
has healed it always remains a weak point, and cases of rupture
of the stomach in old cicatrices are described by Chiari.</p>

<p><i>Treatment.</i> The pain is the most important criterion as a
guide during the treatment. It is the signal by which I judge
of the present condition of the ulcer. According to the variation
of its character and intensity, I can judge whether the ulcer
is healing, is remaining stationary, or is spreading and increasing
in size or depth in spite of the treatment. If the pain has been
removed permanently the ulcer has been healed. From the relation
of this symptom to different kinds of food you can also
judge of a progress or improvement of the ulcer.</p>

<p>Theoretically considered, that form of treatment would seem
the best which gives the stomach absolute rest, entire abstinence
from food, a fast of several weeks. But this can not be carried
out in practice. The patient could be nourished per rectum,
you might say, by means of nutrient enemata. In my opinion
this method of nourishment does not amount to much. I believe
that very little water is absorbed by the rectum, the patient
would suffer from thirst and you would then be compelled to
allow him to drink water at least.</p>

<p>Luckily we do not need to resort to such extreme measures
in the majority of cases. With the exclusive use of the proper
bland, liquid food, we usually attain the same results. In the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">« 156 »</a></span>
treatment of gastric ulcer I lay the main stress on the restriction
and regulation of the diet, and put the patient on an exclusive
milk diet. Milk contains all the constituents necessary for the
nourishment of the human body.</p>

<p>I begin by giving every half hour to one hour a small quantity
of skimmed, boiled milk, which has been cooled on ice.
The patient must rest in bed or on a lounge, as he is weakened
by the treatment, and can not follow his usual avocation. I
forbid all other articles of food. With this diet a patient with
ulcer should have no pain and usually has none. Should there
be pain it is necessary to find out whether the feeling described
as such be not simple oppression, or a feeling of weight in the
stomach. Some patients do not seem to digest milk well. It
ferments, forms gases and then they have this feeling of oppression.
Some drink the milk too fast and take too much at a
time, swallowing a lot of air with the milk, thus distending their
stomachs unnecessarily. The patient must be instructed to
drink the milk slowly, and only take a small quantity at a
time (about one or two ounces). Some patients can not stand
iced milk but bear luke warm milk much better. Others seem
to prefer milk which has slightly soured.</p>

<p>The patients should adhere to this strict diet as long as possible,
regulating the length of time according to the duration
and intensity of the disease. They have to observe the above
rules one or two weeks at least, several weeks if possible.</p>

<p>Often you will meet with the reply: "I have already tried
this diet, I was put on milk diet once before by Dr. &mdash;&mdash; and it
did not help me any, I even felt worse afterwards." If you inquire
more closely, however, you will find that they drank milk several
times a day, but ate bread with it, soaking this in the milk.
This is what is understood to be a milk cure. Gentlemen! I
am sorry to say that this misunderstanding is not confined to
the general public, but that some physicians even do not know
better, and consider such a course of diet a milk diet. I cannot
impress it upon your minds any too strongly not to allow yourselves
to be diverted from your purpose by any such assertions,
but to order another course of milk diet, wherever you find it
indicated, and see to it that it is carried out properly this time.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">« 157 »</a></span>
You will thereby occasionally meet with excellent success where
a previous wrong attempt in the same direction failed.</p>

<p>After the patient has been free from pain from eight to ten
days, I then add to his diet soft boiled eggs with a slight addition
of salt, beginning on the first day with one half of an
egg. If this is well borne I gradually allow more day by day,
until he is able to digest four or five a day without difficulty.
Eggs do not agree with some patients. In such cases I pass on
the use of meat. I have beefsteak chopped fine, roasted in little
meat cakes of the size of a silver half dollar. One of these
is given to begin with, and if well borne repeated every two or
three hours as long as there is no pain. When eggs agree I
prefer to give them for a few days before beginning with the
meat, waiting until such patients can digest four or five eggs a
day. After the meat has been borne well in small quantities
for a while, I gradually increase the quantity taken per day until
it reach a pound or two.</p>

<p>You cannot be too careful and should instruct the patient to
return to the strict milk diet as soon as any pain is felt, no matter
how nicely he may have been getting along up to the time.
Not until the patient has been entirely free from pain for several
weeks is it advisable to allow the use of cereals boiled in
milk, such as rice or tapioca. Then he can also be allowed to
take a quarter of a biscuit (well baked) at each meal. A full
meal, however, in the sense in which it is ordinarily understood,
a large quantity of food taken at one time, is still to be avoided.
It is better to give small quantities of food oftener, in order not
to distend the stomach, and thus run the danger of too great a
strain upon the newly healed ulcer.</p>

<p>These meat cakes made of beef can be taken for a week or
so, and then if well borne other kinds of meat may be occasionally
substituted.</p>

<p><i>Wine and alcoholic liquors in general</i> are to be avoided for several
months.</p>

<p><i>Beer</i> should never be taken by one who has suffered from
gastric ulcer. In fact it is well for all who have stomach trouble
to avoid the use of beer, especially such as have had ulcer.
Such patients have to be on their guard in matters of diet
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">« 158 »</a></span>
through the remainder of their lives, and must avoid excesses
both in eating and drinking. You will occasionally come across
persons who can not stand a milk diet in any form whatever.
They frequently do not bear eggs well. In such cases I proceed
at once, but with great care, to the use of meat in very
small quantities, finally chopped and roasted, and have it taken
several times a day. You will frequently have to try one
article of food and then another, and experiment for awhile
before you reach that form of diet which suits the case best.</p>

<p>There are a number of <i>substitutes</i>, some of which are really
good, while others are worthless. Of them all I prefer the
fresh meat juice <i>ext. carnis recent. pressum</i>, and have it prepared
in the following manner: The meat (beef should be used) is
cut into thin slices, placed between pieces of tissue paper, and
pressed in a hydraulic press. The juice thus obtained is given
in teaspoon doses every half hour or so, just as though it were
medicine. In the majority of cases I have the meat juice made
by the druggist, so that a large number of the patients think it
is medicine. It has a rather pleasant taste and is well borne by
the stomach. There are a great many <i>peptones</i> in the market,
a large number of which ought not to be used, as they are not
fresh and more likely to do harm than good. Of them all the
English make is the best, as it is usually well preserved, being
packed dry.</p>

<p>Patients who can only take a small quantity of nourishment
by the stomach can be materially aided by the use of nutritious
enemata given luke warm once or twice a day. When the
rectum is very irritable a suppository containing one-half to
one grain of ext. opii given a half hour before the enema is
very serviceable. There are a great many <i>other remedies</i> recommended
in the text books, but I would advise you not to rely
too much on them. Lay your main stress on the dietetic part
of the treatment, and use remedies only where they are absolutely
necessary to support this. Among the remedies used
the alkalies are the most valuable. Bicarbonate of soda alone,
or in combination with ext. belladonna when the stomach is
very irritable.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">« 159 »</a></span></p>

<p>
<span style="margin-left: 1em;">&#8478;&nbsp; Sod. Bicarb.,&nbsp;  &#658;iss.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Ext. Belladon., gr ii. Misce et div. in pulv. XVI.</span><br />
<span style="margin-left: 2.5em;">Sig. One in the morning and one in the evening.</span><br />
</p>

<p>Or I sometimes substitute atropia sulph. (1/120 gr. pro dosi)
for the belladonna. At any rate the use of alkalies is the most
plausible treatment. But the permanent alkalization of the
contents of the stomach by the frequent use of large doses
of alkalies, as has been recommended in Paris by Debove is not
plausible, as by this the process of digestion would be checked
entirely.</p>

<p>It is also good to give a dose of Carlsbad salts in the morning
every two or three days, in order to correct the constipation
usually attendant upon such a course of diet. These salts also
aid in rendering the contents of the stomach more alkaline, and
in this way aid the plan spoken of before.</p>

<p>I do not think it advisable to send patients with gastric ulcers
to <i>health resorts</i> or watering places. They can only regain their
health by a strict enforcement of dietetic measures, and these
can be carried out just as well at the patient's home as at the
health resort. For the treatment of such cases <i>after the ulcer</i>
has healed, these health resorts can be of great benefit, but the
patient must be cautioned not to commit excesses in eating or
drinking, especially to the latter must their attention be called,
as it is customary in most resorts adapted to such cases, to drink
large quantities of the medicated waters in the morning. It is
also well to caution the patients with regard to their diet before
sending them away. This should be unirritating, bland and
easily digestible. Among the European health resorts, Carlsbad
is the most suitable for such cases.</p>

<p>There are unfortunately some patients who are not benefited
by any method of treatment hitherto thought of, but luckily they
are few, and if you will follow the rules I have laid down you
will in a great many cases meet with splendid results.</p>

<p>One important question still remains to be answered, namely:
"What should be done in case of hemorrhage of the stomach?"
Here the patient must be left quiet just where he happens to
be&mdash;placed in a horizontal position on his back if possible. Ice
bags should be applied to the region of the stomach, small
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">« 160 »</a></span>
pieces of ice swallowed, and hypodermic injections of ergotin
given. This is all that can be done with benefit in such cases.
The patient should not be transported for several hours.
Monsel's solution can be of no service, as it cannot be introduced
into the stomach in a sufficient concentration to be of
benefit.</p>

<p>In cases of perforation of an ulcer all that can be done is to
give anodynes to ease the pain and make the patient's condition
as comfortable as possible. Schlipp recommends that when perforation
is threatened on account of gaseous distention of the
stomach, the stomach tube should be used to evacuate the
organ.</p>

<p>The mechanical treatment, washing out the stomach with the
stomach tube or stomach pump is contraindicated in cases
of ulcer, as more damage can be done by such procedure than
good.</p>

<p class="caption3">THE RECOGNITION OF MORTIFIED BOWEL IN<br />
                     OPERATIONS FOR THE RELIEF OF<br />
                         STRANGULATED HERNIA.</p>

<p class="caption4"><span class="smcap">By REUBEN A. VANCE, M. D., CLEVELAND, OHIO.</span></p>

<p>The medical practitioner who has been hastily summoned to
operate upon a patient with strangulated hernia finds himself
confronted with problems, the gravity of which can alone be
appreciated by those who have frequently met them. The
medical treatment to be adopted, the extent to which taxis
should be employed, and the time it is prudent to delay operative
interference when other measures have proved fruitless,
are grave questions upon the solution of which the life of the
patient depends. The operation decided upon, the particular
method to be employed and the manner of dealing with the
stricture&mdash;with or without opening the sac&mdash;are matters of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">« 161 »</a></span>
minor consequence, and affairs that should be settled in the
mind of every practitioner by a reference to sound surgical
principles and the teachings of experience. There are questions
connected with the condition of the parts strangulated
that must be solved by the surgeon during the progress of the
operation, about which much less is said in works on surgery
than their importance warrants. These pertain to the vitality
of the part that has been strangulated, and the duty of the surgeon
in the premises. If the part is still living, it matters not
how much damaged by compression, it should be returned at
once into the abdomen; upon this step the patient's life depends.
If the part is mortified and dead, to return it within
the cavity of the belly is to insure the patient's destruction; if
he is to have a chance for life, other measures must be
adopted.</p>

<p>Again, the decision of the operator can but rarely be guided
or aided by aught but the conditions revealed by his knife during
the operation. The state of the patient and the history of
the case may indicate the imminence of mortification of the
bowel; in the end the appeal is to the senses of the surgeon,
and upon the conclusion at which he then arrives will depend
the fate of the patient.</p>

<p>Under these circumstances it behooves every man who may
be placed in position to make such a momentous decision to at
least go to the task, sustained by every aid that can be derived
from the experience of those who themselves have been placed
in this dilemma and compelled to act with such lights as they
then possessed&mdash;whose records, next to personal experience,
become the best guide for those forced to follow in their footsteps.</p>

<p>The history of the case may throw some light upon the state
of the intestine. This is especially so in those cases in which
the severity of the symptoms suddenly subsides without the
rupture having been reduced. The pain is violent, the abdomen
distended and singultus and stercoracious vomiting present;
suddenly the patient's suffering cease, and were it not for the
cold extremities, flickering pulse and persistent tumor&mdash;but
above all, the teachings of experience&mdash;the surgeon could not
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">« 162 »</a></span>
but acknowledge that all tangible appearances portended a
change for the better. Yet, almost invariably gangrene of the
gut has taken place, and the fallacious evidences of improvement
above noted are in reality its best clinical exponent.
Certain almost as these signs are, when present, yet it comparatively
seldom happens that the surgeon has their aid in guiding
him in the measures he must adopt; they form, but infrequently,
a part of the history of cases submitted to operation.
If present, the surgeon is reasonably sure of what he will find
when he operates; they may be absent and mortification yet
exist. The patient's chance of life depends upon the surgeon's
ability to recognize mortification of the bowel when he sees it,
and his promptitude and skill in dealing with it when present.</p>

<p>It scarcely need be said that mere darkening in color of the
bowel, effusion of fluid into the sac, or exudation of lymph
about the stricture are of no special significance in this connection,
and bear in no way upon the presence or absence of mortification.
It has been again and again repeated in manuals
treating of hernia operations that a deep, purplish discoloration
of the bowel and absence of circulation indicate mortification;
that when these physical signs are present the surgeon should
press upon the strictured part, and if the color remains unchanged
when the finger is removed, the bowel is dead. It
requires but little practical experience in dealing with these
cases to appreciate the fallacious character of these signs; the
gut may be fairly black from congestion and yet alive; the
color may remain unchanged under pressure and still that fact
have no bearing on the question of mortification, for a band of
stricture, as yet unappreciated, may be the sole cause of the
persistent hyperæmia.</p>

<p>It is quite different as regards certain other signs, especially
when two or more of them are seen in conjunction. <i>If the
bowel be dark and mottled with grayish spots, of contracted and
shrivelled aspect, with a slight amount of discolored fluid surrounding
the gut, and a cadaveric odor apparent when the sac is opened</i>,
mortification is certainly present, and the return of the strictured
part within the abdominal cavity dooms the patient to
certain death. The surgeon's duty is to open the sphacelated
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">« 163 »</a></span>
gut, apply a poultice and favor the relief of the obstructed
bowel by a free discharge of the intestinal contents through the
outlet thus formed. An artificial anus is thus established, and
the patient, for a time, must be content with this deformity;
fortunately it is a condition susceptible of relief, and the surgeon
may ultimately free his patient of even this defect.</p>

<p class="caption2">JABORANDI AS A GALACTAGOGUE.</p>

<p class="caption3">JOHN H. LOWMAN, M. D.</p>

<p class="caption4">Professor of Materia Medica in the Medical Department of the Western Reserve
                              University.</p>

<p>There is a decided difference of opinion among therapeutics
as to the effect of jaborandi on the mammary gland. Some
claim that it has no effect upon the gland. Some claim that it
assists in increasing the secretion of milk.</p>

<p>This note is made to show the action of jaborandi as a galactagogue
in the recent puerperal state. The preparation used
was the fluid extract obtained from Squibb &amp; Co.</p>

<p>M. S., age thirty-five years, a multipara, of fair health,
not well nourished. The babe was two weeks old at the time
of this observation, and in good condition. The secretion of
milk by the mother began gradually to fail until not one-third
the average quantity was produced. The child was then nourished
artificially. The fluid extract of jaborandi was given
to the mother. The dose was eight minims every three hours.
About fifty minims were taken in twenty-four hours. On
the second day of the administration of the drug the milk
increased in quantity. By the third day it had increased still
more, so that the child had nourishment from the mother sufficient
to satisfy it. Increased salivary and cutaneous secretions
led to a discontinuance of the drug. The milk flowed in good
quantities for eight days, and then rapidly diminished. Jaborandi
was again used. The plan of administration was the same.
Increase of the milk was again noted. The renewed activity of
the mammary glands continued for five or six days only. For
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">« 164 »</a></span>
a third time the drug was used, and its use followed by good
effects. In the meantime the nourishment of the mother had
been pushed. Iron, quinine and mineral acids were also given.
The general health of the patient improved. After the last
increased activity the secretion of the gland remained normal
for three weeks, after which the patient passed from observation.
During the last two weeks no jaborandi was used.</p>

<p>Whereas in this case the improved condition of the individual
was responsible for the permanent increase in the supply of
milk, the use of the jaborandi and the temporary increase were
apparently more than coincidental. During the first two
stimulations the quality of the milk deteriorated; the quantity
of cream diminished; the specific gravity fell; no microscopic
examination of the milk was made. After the last increase in
the activity of the glands the quality of the milk was good.</p>

<p>Two similar cases were noted. B., aged nineteen years,
primipara, had a tedious labor. She recovered slowly. She
was well nourished and has previously been well. At the end
of the second week of convalescence the milk began to fail.
Jaborandi was used as in the case just cited. Marked improvement
in the milk was noticed the second day the drug was
given. On the fourth day the medicine was omitted. The
milk continued to flow in sufficient quantities for ten days.
The quantity then gradually and rapidly diminished. The
medicine was again given for four days with the desired effect,
which remained for the following ten days that the patient was
under observation.</p>

<p>D., age twenty-five years, a multipara, was a poorly nourished
person, the mother of two children. The confinement
was normal. The milk failed soon after its appearance. Following
the use of jaborandi the milk increased rapidly in quantity,
but diminished in three days on withdrawing the drug.
The milk continued to respond to the jaborandi for the four
weeks that the patient was under observation, but no permanent
result was obtained.</p>

<p>On three other cases the jaborandi was used with scarcely
perceptible effect or no effect at all. From a few cases it is impossible
to generalize with expectation of a truthful conclusion.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">« 165 »</a></span>
We can, however, know that the jaborandi has an effect on the
mammary gland, and causes an increase of the milk in puerperal
women. This effect is by no means a constant sequel to
the administration of the drug. As far as my observation is
concerned the effect of jaborandi is temporary, and can be useful
only where there is a tendency in the gland to assume its
normal function. This tendency may at times be subordinated
to general influences and even entirely subdued. In such conditions
a timely stimulation of the gland may tide over the
threatening arrest of function. Variation in the activity of the
mammary gland, especially in the early puerperal state, is not
unusual. The close relation of the increase of milk and the
use of jaborandi justifies, however, the assumption of effect and
cause.</p>

<p>No effect was observed on the children. Jaborandi is excreted
by the mammary glands, and it was consequently withheld
as soon as practicable, lest the child should feel its
presence.</p>

<p class="caption2">INDICATIONS FOR OPENING THE MASTOID PROCESS.</p>

<p class="caption3">BY A. R. BAKER, M. D., CLEVELAND, OHIO.</p>

<p>The operation of opening the mastoid process is said by
some to have been first performed by Riolan in 1649; according
to others, by Petit in 1750, and later by Jasser, in 1776.
During the latter part of the eighteenth century the operation
was performed frequently without definite pathological indications.
But after the unfortunate death of the Danish physician
Berger (1791) the operation was very seldom or never performed
until 1864, by Mayer, following the suggestions made by
Tröltsch some years previous. Berger, for chronic deafness without
suppuration of the middle ear, had the operation performed
upon himself, and died on the twelfth day from meningitis.
During the past twenty years the operation has taken its place
as one of the recognized surgical proceedings owing to the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">« 166 »</a></span>
work of the German physicians Moos, Jacobi, Hartman, Bezold,
Schwartz and others, who have laid down the real indications
for the operation from their extensive clinical observations and
pathological researches. The American otologists, Roosa,
Agnew, Buck and others were among the very first to perform
the operation, and have done much to establish its claim to
recognition. And yet it is somewhat remarkable that some of
our text books barely mention the operation; and as short a
time ago as 1883, Strawbridge, at the meeting of the American
Otological Society, said that he had seen over four thousand
cases of purulent middle ear disease within twelve years, and
yet had not trephined in a single case; and several other authorities
looked upon the operation as a questionable one. Knapp
took decided grounds in favor of the operation, and cited three
fatal cases in which he believed an operation would have saved
life. Kipp had seen quite a number of fatal cases in which
the post-mortem had shown the mastoid cells filled with pus,
which had given rise to cerebral abscess. Dr. C. H. Burnett
reported a fatal case which died from pyemia, and he thought
if his patient had been operated a year before his life would
have been saved.</p>

<p>Gruening said surgery has established that wherever there
is a focus of purulent discharge it should be removed. This,
(removal of the focus) is a life-saving operation and should be
done under all circumstances. Dr. Roosa said that he believed
the revival of this operation of opening the mastoid process has
saved many lives. Since his first operation not a year has passed
that he has not found it necessary to repeat it several times.
He says further that "it is true that we shall seldom need to
open the mastoid if an experienced practitioner sees a case of
acute aural disease early in its course. It is an operation for
neglected cases, where suppuration has been allowed to advance
from the tympanic cavity in consequence of not having a free
outlet through the drum-head. But purulent inflammation of
the mastoid may occur in acute cases that have been thoroughly
treated by leeching, poultices, rest, etc., from the start."</p>

<p>The most recently stated indications for opening the mastoid
process are:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">« 167 »</a></span></p>

<p>1. Purulent inflammation in the mastoid process appearing in
the course of suppuration of the middle ear when persistent
severe pain in the bone cannot be subdued by the application
of the ice-bag, leeches, or by Wilds' incision. (Schwartz).</p>

<p>2. Painful inflammation in the mastoid process occurring in
acute and chronic suppuration of the middle ear, in consequence
of growths filling up the external meatus or the tympanic
cavity. When attempts to remove the obstacle to the free
escape of pus have failed, the operation is imperative. (Grüning).
The operation is indicated even though the soft parts over the
mastoid are not swollen or infiltrated. (Politzer).</p>

<p>3. When the posterior superior wall of the meatus is bulging,
and when after incision the abscess is not emptied and the
symptoms of retention of pus continue. (Toynbee, Duplay).</p>

<p>4. Persistent pain and tenderness in the mastoid process
lasting for days or weeks, in which there is probably an osseous
abscess not communicating with the tympanic cavity. (Politzer).</p>

<p>5. In every suppuration of the middle ear combined with
inflammation of the mastoid process in which fever, vertigo and
headache are developed during the course of the affection,
which may indicate a dangerous complication. In such cases
the indication for the operation is vital. (Politzer, Roosa, Buck.)</p>

<p>As to the time when the operation should be performed,
writers do not agree. While one proposes that the operation
should be done as soon as there are symptoms of inflammation
of the mastoid process, another defers it till the dangerous
symptoms (fever, headache, vertigo, etc.,) set in. The latter
proposal must not be followed, as in many cases it would be too
late; on the other hand, many cases will recover without an
operation. As far as it can be formulated, I would say that in
a given case of acute purulent inflammation of the mastoid process
I would first apply leeches, poultices, cathartics, antiflogistics.
If the inflammation is not promptly subdued, I would
make a Wilds' incision, including the periosteum, if the bone is
found softened; or if a fistulous opening is found, this should be
enlarged at once. If the bone is found healthy and not roughened,
if there is no fever, vertigo, headache, etc., I would wait
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">« 168 »</a></span>
a few days; if the symptoms, pain, tenderness, etc., do not
subside, I would then perforate the mastoid process.</p>

<p>For the performance of the operation trepans were formerly
used, which were replaced by drills which are still used by
Buck, Jacobi, Lucae and others, but by most operators they
have been set aside, owing to their uncertain and dangerous
advance in the deep parts, and on account of their soiling the
wound with splinters. The most rational and safe method is
by means of the chisel, as recommended by Schwartz, and is
performed as follows: The patient being anæsthetized, a
perpendicular incision beginning a little above the linea temporalis,
extending an inch and a half in length immediately behind
the attachment of the auricle. Formerly I employed a
straight incision, but recently have followed the suggestion of
Politzer, and from the superior end of the perpendicular incision
a second one is made backward at right angles, thus forming
a flap, which I have found to simplify the operation very
much, as it affords a better view of the locality and extent of
any pathological changes which may have taken place, and
gives more room for operative procedures, and the periosteum
can readily be removed to any desired extent. The linea
temporalis and the more or less strongly developed protuberance
on the posterior superior orifice of the osseous meatus, so
strongly urged by authors, are very nice guides theoretically or
to point out on an exceptional skull in the class room, but
practically are seldom well enough developed to be of any
use to the operator. The best guide to go by is to take
the superior wall of the meatus as the upper boundary, and
the angle formed by the plane of the mastoid with the posterior
wall of the external meatus for the anterior boundary when opening
the mastoid. This is best determined by pressing the
finger into the meatus. Often in children, and when the bone is
diseased in adults, the cortical plate of bone can be removed
with the hand chisel, and we come at once upon the pus cavity,
or dipl&#339;, or cholesteatomatous epidermic masses, or a sequestrum
of dead bone, or bleeding granulation tissue, or whatever the case
may present. Sometimes the external plate is very thick and
we have to chisel our way carefully for almost half an inch
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">« 169 »</a></span>
before reaching the dipl&#339;, or may find the entire mastoid process
sclerossed. No absolute rule can be given as to the depth
it is safe to penetrate. Schwartz says "never to go deeper
than 25 mm." Buck says "it is better to place the extreme
limit at 20 mm," about three-fourths of an inch.</p>

<p>Although I do not consider the operation a particularly
dangerous one, especially with the chisel where we can watch
each step of the operation; and even though we opened into the
lateral sinus or the duramater, the injury would not be necessarily
fatal. Yet I would not advise any one to attempt it (unless the indications
are imperative) who has not performed the operation
on the dead subject. Politzer says "no one should operate
on the living before having performed the operation at least
forty or fifty times on the dead." I cannot close this article
better than in the words of Dr. St. John Roosa, to whose admirable
work I am indebted for a large portion of this article.</p>

<p>"Yet, hesitation, when the way is plain, or when the chances
are largely on the side of the necessity of the removal of pus,
cannot be too sternly condemned. No drug has yet been discovered
which can be substituted for the scalpel or trephine
when pus has actually formed in the mastoid cells. I wish,
however, to repeat what I have said before on the subject of
surgical operations. I am in full accord with the great English
surgeon, Sir James Paget, who, in his admirable lectures,
expresses many times his hesitation to perform any surgical
operation, however trivial, that is not absolutely required. We
have no right, I think, to perform operations to clear up doubtful
diagnosis. If in case the operation proves to have been
unnecessary, the patient will be decidedly the worse for it. If
we put ourselves in the place of our patients, what we may
regard as a trifling thing&mdash;"a mere cut"&mdash;will not be so
esteemed. A mere cut, when unnecessary, may have the most
serious consequences, and all the history and symptoms should
be carefully weighed before even that is undertaken. Such
care will never prevent prompt, rapid and thorough surgical
interference when demanded.</p>

<p>In teaching medical students, I have always found them,
when fully awakened to the dangers of neglecting certain diseases,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">« 170 »</a></span>
to be more apt to do too much than too little, especially
with the knife and active drugs. It is possible, also, that the
crying ignorance and neglect of the previous decades in regard
to the treatment of aural disease has had a tendency to cause
us, who see many of the afflictions of the ear, to lean toward
the side of surgical operations upon the drum, head and mastoid.
This is a leaning no less dangerous to the cure of some
cases than was the steering toward Scylla or Charybdis to the
safe navigation of ancient mariners."</p>

<p class="caption2">A CASE OF ANOMALOUS DEVELOPMENT OF THE<br />
                 ANTERIOR PILLARS OF THE SOFT PALATE.</p>

<p class="caption3">BY B. L. MILLIKIN, M. D.,</p>

<p class="caption4">Oculist and Aurist to Charity Hospital, Cleveland, O.</p>

<p>Some time since, Mrs. G. D., age about 23, applied to me
on account of deafness and tinnitus of both ears. In pursuing
my examination I found the following unusual anatomical relations
of the anterior pillars of the soft palate, which I deem
not unworthy of record.</p>

<p>The uvula and posterior border of the soft palate are normal
in appearance and formation; but, beginning about the middle
of the anterior pillars, these gradually widen out into thick,
heavy, broad, muscular folds, which attach themselves firmly
to the sides and dorsum of the tongue, extending two or three
lines upon the dorsum. They seem to be intimately connected
with the muscle of the tongue itself, making them very firm.
The posterior pillars are much less well developed than the anterior,
and do not control or prevent the drawing forward of
the soft palate when the tongue is protruded. The tonsils are
small in size but normally located.</p>

<p>The attachments of these bands give a peculiar appearance
to the throat. When the tongue is in a state of rest, in the
bottom of the mouth, or, better still, when the tongue is depressed,
these bands hang like two large curtains, narrowing
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">« 171 »</a></span>
very much the faucial opening. When the tongue is protruded
they are put upon the stretch, and narrow very greatly the
faucial opening by drawing forward and downward the whole of
the soft palate, so that the posterior border of the soft palate
and uvula rest firmly upon the dorsum of the tongue. When
the tongue is thus protruded the attachments of these membranes
are brought forward almost to the teeth.</p>

<p>In a state of relaxation there is formed back of these folds,
on either side, quite a deep cavity, which often collects quantities
of solid food, to the great annoyance of the patient. She
even sometimes is obliged to remove these obstructions with
the fingers, or, by gulping or swallowing frequently, is able to
dislodge them. She has no difficulty in swallowing liquids.</p>

<p>There is some impediment in her speech, a peculiar lisping
as if she did not have good control of her tongue, which she
has always attributed to the fact that she is of German parentage.
Her English is, however, very good, other than as above
indicated.</p>

<p>In looking up what anatomical literature is at my command,
I find no reference to any anomalies of this kind, although I
have been able to consult the standard French, German and
English works on general anatomy. I myself have never seen
a case with an anatomical construction approaching this, so I,
therefore, present it for record.</p>

<p class="caption2">HINTS ON VOCAL TRAINING&mdash;THE BREATH.</p>

<p class="caption3"><span class="smcap">By BERNARD W. FISHER, A. M.</span></p>

<p>The prevalence of throat troubles is so marked in America,
and by no means least so in this city, that if one hundred individuals,
collected at random, had their throats examined, it is
probable that four out of every five would be found to have
these delicate organs more or less affected. Whatever cause
may be assigned by the medical expert in each particular case,
the importance of a thorough mastery of the art of correct
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">« 172 »</a></span>
breathing can hardly be insisted upon too strongly. If it be
urged that the widely distributed works of Behnke and others
must have put an end to any general ignorance of the importance
of this branch of vocal training, I can only reply that a
defective style of breathing is by no means uncommon even in
public singers, while among amateurs it is so rare that a perfect
management of the breath excites in a critical observer a feeling
of gratified surprise. The name and works of Behnke
have, of course, been known in this country for a considerable
time, but some of his statements are too striking to be omitted
in an article on this subject. When lecturing at the Tonic
Sol-fa College, London, he took ten students and measured
their lung capacity in cubic inches, by means of the spirometer,
with wrong or "collar-bone" breathing. He then showed
them how to breathe correctly, that is, midriff and rib breathing.
The average increase among the ten was twenty-five cubic
inches of air; the least increase twelve inches, and the greatest
forty-five. He adds: "I imagine that these figures are more
eloquent than any words, and I think it superfluous to make
any further comment on them."&mdash;('Mechanism of the Human
Voice,' page 20.) Now, putting aside the extreme increase of
forty-five inches, let anyone consider what an increase in lung
capacity of twenty-five cubic inches of air must mean to the
vocalist in the execution of difficult passages, to the speaker
using his voice by the hour, and, lastly, to the running athlete.
It will surprise a young man commencing vocal training to
inform him that, at the same time, he will become a better man
in the gymnasium and the race; but unless good lungs are an
advantage to the athlete in name only, the above figures tell
their own tale. I may add that, in teaching young men and
boys, I always put this view of the subject before them, knowing
that it will be an incentive to their acquiring a thorough
mastery over the interesting art of "taking breath."</p>

<p>Correct breathing cannot <i>cure</i> disease. The medical expert
must do that. But it will <i>prevent</i> disease; and when the throat,
under proper treatment, has been brought to a healthy state, it
will assuredly be the chief means of keeping it in that condition.
The following is a striking instance to the same effect:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">« 173 »</a></span></p>

<p>Some years since, an English clergyman had to give up all
ministerial duty from "Clerical Sore Throat." Acting under
the absurd advice of a London teacher of elocution, he resided
in Spain for five years without the slightest benefit. He then
returned, and at the house of the elocutionist who had made
him an exile saw a copy of Behnke's celebrated work. Coming
to the conclusion that the author must be rather clever, he at
once consulted him. Following his advice he had his throat
made medically sound by Lennox Browne, and then took the
usual course in breathing and voice production under Behnke.
A short time after I was with Herr Behnke, when a post card
arrived from the clergyman: "I preached yesterday in Chichester
cathedral, and was congratulated on the strength of my
voice and the ease with which I filled the building."</p>

<p>A few weeks since I heard a sermon in a Cleveland church.
The preacher took short "collar-bone" breathings, using
twice the power necessary for the building, and towards the
conclusion was in evident distress (which naturally communicated
itself to his hearers), a failing voice and perspiring face.
If before entering the ministry he had learned to breathe and
use his voice properly, such troubles could never have
existed.</p>

<p>There is yet another unpleasant affliction which correct
breathing will rarely fail to cure, a high-pitched and effeminate
voice in a man. I quote again a case from the same work:</p>

<p>Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;, a tall, thin young man, engaged in evangelistic
work, suffered from "weakness of voice." He spoke chiefly
in a "child voice," over which he had very little control. His
breathing power increased by sixty cubic inches in two lessons.
"In one week more," adds Herr Behnke, "I could dismiss
him with a full, sonorous man's voice in place of the uncertain
child's squeak with which he had come to me."</p>

<p>I must lastly point out that the cure of stammering often
entirely depends on the management of the breath, and in all
cases it must be an important agent.</p>

<p>The limits of this paper allow but a brief notice of the best
course for a breathing instructor to follow. Let the pupil lie
down on his back, place the hand lightly on the lower part of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">« 174 »</a></span>
the lungs, and tell him to inhale easily through the nostrils,
allowing the air to fill the lower part of the lungs, avoiding all
motion of the shoulders and heaving up of the chest. When
the lungs are fully inflated count four with deliberation, and let
the pupil inhale all the air as suddenly as possible. Gradually
increase the counting week by week up to twelve, which marks
a real control over the unused muscles. The next course is for
the pupil to inhale suddenly and exhale slowly. The instruction
given is of necessity meagre, but it need hardly be pointed
out, no written directions can take the place of personal teaching.
From four to six weeks is usually sufficient for the young
and vigorous to gain command over the breathing apparatus;
older pupils have sometimes great difficulty in mastering the
muscles, unruly through disuse.</p>

<p>Herr Behnke allows no use of the voice beyond ordinary
speaking while the breathing exercises are going on. I have
followed this rule much modified, and do not find the results
unsatisfactory.</p>

<p class="pmb4">The total neglect of this important subject in both American
and English schools is to me perfectly astounding. Half an
hour a week for three months would be ample for the purpose.
These few hours would confer a benefit of the highest value,
and lasting a lifetime.</p>

<p>The editor of the Cincinnati Medical Journal asks the secretaries

upon the following propositions:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">« 176 »</a></span></p>

<p>1. To so change the constitution of the State Society as to
make the members of county societies members of the State
Society simply by virtue of their local membership.</p>

<p>2. Present members of the State Society to remain members
without reference to membership in local societies.</p>

<p>3. All members to stand upon an equal footing, thus doing
away with the delegate system.</p>

<p class="caption3">MEDICAL PRACTICE BILL.</p>

<p>A bill to establish a medical board of examiners and licenses,
and to regulate the practice of medicine and surgery in the
State of Ohio, and to define the duties and powers of such
board, will be presented to the Legislature of Ohio. It provides
for:</p>

<p>1. A mixed board so far as schools are concerned.</p>

<p>2. No attache of a medical college is eligible to a place on
the board.</p>

<p>3. All candidates for the practice of medicine in Ohio shall
submit to an examination by this board.</p>

<p>4. None but graduates in medicine and surgery shall be eligible
to examination.</p>

conduct.</p>

<p>6. Graduates at present practicing in the State may continue
without submitting to an examination, but must register in the
office of the probate judge.</p>

<p>These are the essential features of the bill, and on the whole
good. It does not interfere with physicians already in practice,
which has caused the failure of nearly every bill presented to
the Ohio Legislature becoming a law. Excluding college professors
from becoming members of the board is fair to the profession,
and saves the bill from being the tool of the medical
colleges, unlike the Pennsylvania law, and yet it does not

ignore the medical schools entirely as educational and graduating
bodies, like the Illinois and West Virginia laws. It is

<p class="caption3">PHYSICAL EXAMINATION OF YOUNG GIRLS.</p>

<p>The following remarks were made by the president of the
Royal College of Physicians, December 28, and were the result
of an inquiry into the conduct of Dr. Haywood Smith, by the
college, for having physically examined the girl, Eliza Armstrong,
without the consent of parent or guardian:</p>

<p>"It is, in the opinion of this college, a grave professional
and moral offence for any physician to examine physically a
young girl, <i>even</i> at the request of a parent, without having first
satisfied himself that some decided medical good is likely to
accrue to the patient from the examination, and, also, without
having first explained to the parent or legal guardian of the
girl the advisability of such examination in general and the
special objections that exist to their being made. Moreover,
the college feels that a young girl should on no consideration
be examined, excepting in the presence of a matron of mature
age, and, so far as the physician knows, of good moral character...."
The rest of the remarks were put direct to
Dr. Smith, and are of no general interest.</p>

<p>The decision of the college was favorable to Dr. Smith; his
name was <i>not</i> erased from the roll.</p>

<p class="caption3">SUET BANDAGES.</p>

<p>"These are admirable for dressing. You can make them
by melting mutton tallow over a slow fire. Have your
bandages of close cloth, ready cut the proper length
and breadth, dip them into the suet; when saturated, hold them
so as to let them drip off, or the grease may be spread upon
the cloth. Hang them over a line where they may be protected
from dust; let them cool, fold them, put away for use.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">« 178 »</a></span>
These bandages are especially adapted to dress old ulcers and
wounds. They are smooth and adapt themselves perfectly to
the surface; are agreeable to the patient, and can be medicated
with any therapeutical agent you wish."&mdash;<i>American Medical
Digest</i>, quoting Dr. Edwin Brock in <i>New England Medical
Monthly</i>.</p>

<p>A disadvantage of the tallow bandage is its becoming rancid.
Vaseline, not becoming rancid, has been tried, but melts too
easily. For most purposes the wax bandage is as good as the
tallow, perfectly smooth and does not become rancid, but
cannot very well be medicated. A useful material for a bandage
of this kind is the paraffine, as recommended by Tait.</p>

<p>The tallow bandage can be put to another use by those who
do not live convenient to an instrument dealer. When made
wide the tallow bandage can be rolled into a very good rectal
bougie, large or smaller as you wish by a few more or less
thicknesses of the cloth. By the same means a very good
vaginal dilator can be extemporized for cases of stricture or
vaginismus. But where it is to remain long <i>in situ</i> for these
cases beeswax or a mixture of beeswax and tallow, which are
generally available in the country, make a better substitute.
"Cere cloth" was formerly much used by gynecologists.</p>

all that is new and valuable in these special departments,
the colored lithographs and wood engravings with which the

<i>Stated Meeting, January 18th, 1886.</i><br />

<span class="smcap">President pro. tem., D. W. Graham, M. D., in the chair.</span></p>

<p>Dr. E. J. Doering read a paper entitled</p>

<p class="caption3">MUTUAL PROTECTION AGAINST BLACKMAIL.</p>

<p>The author stated that among the many trials which physicians
have to encounter in the practice of their profession is
the ever-existing liability of being blackmailed. This may
either assume the more frequent form of a so-called malpractice
suit, or the relatively less frequent charge of a criminal assault,
according to the viciousness of the complainant. Such suits
against physicians are increasing. One reason quoted was the
fact that every city is overrun with petty lawyers, who have
little or nothing to do, and are always willing to encourage any
suit whatever, if there be the least prospect of getting something
out of the defendant. The author stated that since investigating
the matter he became convinced that many of these blackmail
schemes were settled before being made public. Many a physician
preferred being robbed of one or two hundred dollars, rather
than incur the publicity, the loss of time and the endless expense
of a lawsuit. Again, the average jury, composed of the ignorant
and illiterate, will always have a strong leaning toward the complainant
and against the defendant in a malpractice suit, as
physicians are popularly supposed to be capitalists. The author
stated that personally he had never been sued or even threatened
with a suit, and it was therefore from no motive of selfish
interest, but from a sincere regard for the welfare of the profession,
that he advocated the formation of an association for the
mutual protection of physicians against blackmailing suits of all
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">« 180 »</a></span>
kinds. His plan is to organize a society composed of two or
three hundred members of the regular profession, all of whom
shall be of acknowledged ability, possessing a good moral character
and standing in the community. Said association to employ
the best legal talent attainable, by the year, to furnish the
members such legal advice as they may desire at any time and
defend any suit against the members arising in the discharge
of their professional duties. It was stated that the expense to
each member of an association composed of about two hundred
would not exceed five dollars per annum, and that an initiation
fee of five dollars would create a sufficient fund for court expenses.
Such an association would be a power in preventing
suits. Let it be known that the individual physician is backed
by the financial and moral support of a few hundred of the best
physicians, and aided by the best legal talent obtainable, and he
will be let severely alone by the offscouring and dregs of society
who constitute, almost without exception, the blackmailing element
in our professional life. The author stated that he was
not aware of the existence of such an association as the one proposed
in any other city, but the principle at least has been
carried out recently by the New York County Medical Society,
in voting $500 to assist in the defense of the Drs. Purdy, members
of the Society, in the case of Brown <i>vs.</i> Purdy. After
reading a number of letters from prominent physicians in favor
of forming a protective association, and presenting several legal
opinions sustaining the advisability, practicability and legal status
of such a society, the author concluded by stating his firm belief
that such an association for mutual protection was needed,
that it would be a power for good, that it would draw the profession
closer together, that, in short, it would be based on the
principles of a common brotherhood, viz.: equality, harmony,
justice and unity.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F. C. Hotz</span> said that the extract of his letter to Dr.
Doering, which was incorporated in the paper, indicated that at
the time it was written he did not think favorably of the project.
And, after listening with much interest to the doctor's
arguments, he saw no reason for changing his opinion. Professional
reputation and honor is the most personal of all personal
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">« 181 »</a></span>
property; if he lost it, it does not hurt anybody but
himself, and therefore if any attack be made on it he should
certainly wish to employ among the able lawyers the one in
whose ability he had the greatest confidence. But he was not
sure whether the lawyer retained by this protective union would
be the one to whom he should like to trust the defense of his
reputation. The attorney might be able, or abler, than the
lawyer of his own choice; but should the case go against him,
he should never feel satisfied that the lawyer had done all that
could be done for him unless he had full confidence in him. It
is with the lawyer as with the physician, a question of confidence,
and his patrons find no fault with his treatment as long
as they have implicit faith in his ability.</p>

<p>An objection of greater weight, however, has been urged by
several of the doctor's correspondents in asking what possible
effect it might have if the fact was brought out in court that the
defendant belonged to such a union? The lawyers whose opinions
were obtained and read by the doctor, say it cannot legally affect
the case. There is no doubt but what this is true. But the
verdict of a jury in malpractice suits is not determined by the
legal aspect of the case; and circumstances which cannot have
any legal effect upon the case have often made a deep impression
upon a jury and decided the case against the physician.
To illustrate: In Dr. Bettman's first trial, the experts of the
prosecution testified so unreservedly in the doctor's favor that
had the case been submitted to the jury without arguments, the
doctor would have been acquitted at once. To fortify his cause
Dr. Bettman's lawyer called a number of experts, whose testimony
was of course only cumulative. Now what did the prosecuting
lawyer do? Did he make an effort to break down the
expert evidence by scientific arguments? No, sir; but he
wiped out its effect upon the jury by the mere waving of his
hand, speaking thus: "The defense has piled up a mountain
of expert evidence. But, gentlemen of the jury, what does it
all amount to? These doctors are working together in the
same hospital. Don't you see they have a common interest to
sustain each other, because every one of them may be in the
same fix some day? Don't you know they are clannish?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">« 182 »</a></span>
They wont admit that one of them can make a mistake. O,
no!" One could fairly see the impression this harangue made
upon the jury, and they rendered a verdict against the doctor,
though it is certain the lawyers will say the fact of his being
associated with the experts in the same hospital should and
could legally not prejudice the jury. But it evidently did, all
the same. And after such experience, can you for one
moment believe it would not damage the physician's cause if he
and his experts belonged to a society formed for the express
purpose of mutual assistance in malpractice suits. A mighty
poor lawyer he would be who could not make a great deal out
of it before a jury.</p>

<p>Very interesting was that part of the paper in which the doctor
evolved his idea how his new society could prevent, ward
off, malpractice suits. He believes the shysters would not be
so eager to engage in this business if they knew they had to
fight a corporation with plenty of means to employ the best
legal talent. Why this should discourage those fellows it is
hard to understand. They do not sue poverty-stricken doctors.
Whom they select for their victims they suppose to be rich, and
consequently able to employ a good lawyer. They do not
expect to have all easy game, but why should they not try it?
They don't risk anything by it. The blackmailer's stake is only
two dollars and a half for filing his application, and his lawyer's
stake is his time, which is not worth much anyhow. So you
see they have nothing to lose, but much to gain. What difference
should it make to them whether the opposing counsel is
engaged by one physician or by one hundred? If you wish to
devise means by which this blackmailing nuisance can be
stopped, or at least reduced to a minimum, you must try to get
to the roots of the evil; that is, you must find the causes which
usually bring it forth. And you will not go far to find them,
for you find them right at your door, in your own profession,
in the shape of <i>indiscriminate dispensation of gratuitous services
and of unkind remarks of one physician about another</i>. Physicians
are altogether too quick to give their services gratis to almost any
body at any time. But you know very well people do not
value very much what they can get for the mere asking; they
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">« 183 »</a></span>
do not think much of what they get for nothing. And it is also
a widespread notion (especially among the lower educated
people) that the quality of service is regulated by the amount
of money they pay for it; that the treatment at a free dispensary,
because gratuitous, is not the same, not as good as at a
physician's office where they have to pay for it. These people
cannot persuade themselves that a physician will take the same
interest in a case whether or not he is paid for his services. The
poor, therefore, are always suspicious that they do not get
their full share of attention. They are quickly ready to charge
their physician with carelessness if the case goes wrong. And
with a patient in this frame of mind, it takes but very little
encouragement to begin a suit for damages. And in nine out
of ten cases, doubtless, this encouragement is furnished by the
members of our own profession. He did not mean to charge
physicians with purposely, wilfully, instigating a lawsuit against
a brother. Though this has been done, such extraordinary
baseness is a rare exception.</p>

<p>What Dr. Hotz had reference to is the inconsiderate careless,
thoughtless habit of expressing an opinion about a case, or a
colleague. To illustrate: A physician at a dispensary shows
a bad case to professional friends, and without thinking of the
possible evil consequences, makes in the presence of the patient
some remark like this: "Well, perhaps I ought to have done
this or that." The patient, already laboring under the impression
that he was not fairly treated because he could not pay,
sees in the doctor's remark the strongest confirmation of his
suspicion, goes to a shyster and begins a suit for damages.
And doubtless, in a similar way the mind of a patient is often
poisoned and set against his physician by a careless or unkind
remark of another physician. So many physicians are always
ready to express their opinion about their colleagues in the
presence of anybody, or to criticise their professional acts upon
the information received from a patient or some old woman.
Now you all know how these people misconstrue the words of
a doctor; how they pervert the facts inadvertently. You must
admit you cannot rely on what patients tell you, and you cannot
form an opinion that is worth anything of a case you have
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">« 184 »</a></span>
not seen or been informed about by the attending physician.
Why, then, don't you say so when somebody asks you what
you think about the case of Dr. H.? Or if you know the physician,
say he is competent to attend to his own business; if
you don't know him, change the subject. But at all events,
unless he be a notorious quack, refrain from uttering any words
which even only insinuate the possibility of a mistake or want
of skill of your colleague.</p>

<p>Stop running each other down; stand by each other; sustain
each other, "stick together and be clannish;" let it be understood
in public that no reputable physician will prostitute himself
by going to court as expert for a blackmailer. If all the
reputable physicians of this city adopt and act on this principle,
blackmailing the medical profession would soon be a thing of
the past, and malpractice suits more effectually prevented than
by the organization of a protective union.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. P. S. Hayes</span> said that, from his costly experience in a malpractice
suit, he felt that an association such as suggested by
Dr. Doering would be of great service. The lawyer employed
by such an association would speedily acquire such a fund of
medical knowledge that he would be considered an expert in
malpractice cases. He would not require an amount of coaching
necessary to prepare for any given case, as would be requisite
in the case of a lawyer who had no experience in such
cases. His opportunity for obtaining information in a given
case would be largely extended, for each member of the association
to whom he might apply would be interested in giving him
the desired knowledge. He would soon become acquainted
with medical witnesses and know which would give the best
testimony in any case.</p>

<p>An association of the character suggested by the paper might
be a means of educating its members in regard to laws bearing
on the rights of physicians and their patients, now not generally
understood. For one he is heartily in favor of such an
association, and should give it his hearty support.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. G. C. Paoli</span> said Dr. Doering's paper is not only a valuable
one, but contains such a high, noble, charitable feeling
that the Society ought to be grateful to him. He wondered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">« 185 »</a></span>
that such steps had not been taken before, because so many of
our professional brethren have not only suffered annoyance, but
pecuniary loss as well. How can we expect, from an ignorant
jury, a decision based on scientific knowledge and justice?</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. F. M. Weller</span> said that the subject of the paper was
worthy of consideration; that the discussion of the formation
of an association with an object so widely different from the
Medical Society seemed out of place; the one essentially scientific,
the other in the nature of an insurance. The right to
form such an organization was unquestioned; the policy should
be considered by each individual. That while any one might
be made the object of blackmail, he believed that charges of
malpractice more frequently arose from the ignorance of physicians
of the statutes affecting the practice of medicine, especially
those of the criminal code, and of the rulings of the courts
in cases.</p>

<p class="caption3">COMPULSORY VACCINATION.</p>


<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Himes</span> presiding.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Hart</span> said that thirty years ago, in a country region of
western Pennsylvania, he met an epidemic of smallpox. Over
thirty years earlier, under a State law, the whole community
had been vaccinated. Out of about fifty persons exposed to
the disease the most were adults who had been vaccinated at
the time referred to, or earlier. Referring to an article on the
epidemic prepared at the time, he finds that fully half had the
disease in some form, from the mildest varioloid to confluent
smallpox, one case of secondary smallpox occurring. While
he believed that fifty per cent. of those vaccinated in infancy
are protected for a lifetime, still he regards the presence of the
most distinct cicatrix as no criterion by which to determine
who are thus secure. From twelve to twenty years of age,
probably, fully one-half will have a more or less perfect result
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">« 186 »</a></span>
from revaccination, and will in most cases be thenceforth protected
from all ordinary exposure to smallpox. But in the
presence of the varilous atmosphere of an epidemic of the
disease, revaccination is the only absolute safety. He has
always revaccinated himself as often as exposed, and advised
the same course for others. While smallpox prevailed here,
say from 1865 to 1873, where patients were not removed to a
pest house, and the only precaution enforced was the notice on
the house, he attended a considerable number of cases. He
always insisted on vaccinating every exposed person, and
although there were often unvaccinated children and adults
who had a thorough effect from revaccination, he never had a
second crop of calls in the same house.</p>

<p>He referred to the complete revaccination of the Forty-first
Regiment, O. V. I., before going South. Many of the men
with a fair cicatrix had a perfect revaccination, while two hundred
or three hundred had more or less result. Humanized
virus was used. During their term of service, while repeatedly
exposed to smallpox, and where other regiments about them
suffered severely from the disease, they entirely escaped.
This immunity could only be referred to their revaccination,
and certainly affords the strongest proof of its prophylactic
power.</p>

<p>While frequent renewals of the humanized virus is desirable,
he regarded it, when selected with the care which ought to be
observed, as milder in its effects and much more certain than
cowpox. In vaccinating with cowpox he has had severe effects
follow much more frequently than when he made use of the
humanized virus.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Dutton</span> did not believe that the profession should insist
on compulsory revaccination, at least until it was proven that
revaccination was absolutely necessary. A second vaccination
often produces a serious inflammatory sore, quite unlike the true
vaccine pustule, and an ulcer sometimes follows.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Preston</span> stated that, as he had observed, a large percentage
of those who were not revaccinated were liable to have
varioloid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Scott</span> stated that we must either vaccinate or inoculate.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">« 187 »</a></span>
He was vaccinated by his mother fifty years ago, and was protected
yet. He had been revaccinated many times without
effect. He regarded the humanized scab the best. He believed
that the proportion that take again is less than Dr. Hart
is inclined to suppose. Every community has a right to compel
vaccination, and the question here is not of revaccination.
Bovine virus removes the danger of the communication of
syphilis, but the cultivation of the virus should be under State
control. Much of the trouble had come from scabs or points
from pustules where the lymph had been drawn off and the
pustules allowed to refill. A refilled pustule can communicate
almost anything.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Smith</span> said he had seen some of the worst arms he ever
saw from revaccination. He would rather have a mild case of
varioloid than such a case. It is not certain that a second sore
is evidence that the patient will not have varioloid.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Corlett</span> stated that in the London Smallpox Hospital
they had for twenty years made it a rule to vaccinate every
attendant, and for twenty years there had been no case of smallpox
among the attendants. There is more attention paid to
instruction in vaccination there than here. Each student must
go at least six times to one of the dozen government stations
and receive instruction. Vaccination is done from arm to arm.
As soon as the vesicle is formed, and before pustulation, a
capillary tube is inserted and a portion of the lymph withdrawn.
They do not believe that there is danger of scrofula or syphilis
if there be no admixture of blood cells, either white or red,
with the lymph. He believes that the cases of eczema and
scrofula so often attributed to vaccination are really due to a
dyscrasia of the patient.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Millikin</span> inquired how long the lymph retained its activity
after being withdrawn into the capillary tube. <span class="smcap">Dr. Corlett</span>
stated that it could be used for six weeks or two months.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dr. Vance</span> stated that the Germans of Cincinnati, irrespective
of creed, preferred inoculation to vaccination. Hence
there was always smallpox in Cincinnati. In spite of the stringent
laws against it, inoculation was systematically carried on.
The parent would take the infant to a neighboring hillside and
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">« 188 »</a></span>
leave it with a dollar-bill beside it, and go away. In a few
minutes he would return, the dollar-bill would be gone, and the
child was inoculated. The law against it cannot be enforced.</p>

<p class="caption3">NEW YORK LETTER.</p>

<p class="caption4">THE USES OF COCAINE IN SURGERY.</p>

<p>It is not the object of this communication to speak of the
discovery of this drug and the experiments which were necessary
to bring it before the profession as a reliable and trustworthy
agent. That cocaine is a valuable addition to the armamentarium
of the surgeon, I think no one will doubt, but how beneficial, I
think but few fully realize.</p>

<p>Cocaine is constantly growing in favor with the surgeons
here in New York. New fields of usefulness are opening, and in
nearly all of the minor and many of the major operations it is
taking the place of ether and chloroform. These older anæsthetics,
although so useful, were accompanied by danger, and
many deaths are attributed to their use, while so far, I know of
no well authenticated case where death or serious symptoms
have resulted from the use of this new anæsthetic. Its first use
was restricted almost exclusively to the eye and mucous membrane,
but the hypodermic syringe has made it as useful to the
general surgeon as to the oculist.</p>

<p>There is not a day passes but that we see operations of more
or less magnitude performed under its influence at some
of the clinics or hospitals of New York. Circumcision, hemmorrhoids,
fistula in ano, felon, ingrowing toe-nails, hydrocele, cutting
for foreign bodies, removal of small tumors, etc., are some
of the operations for which we very seldom see an anæsthetic
given.</p>

<p>At St. Luke's hospital an operation for ventral hernia was
performed by the use of cocaine alone, where it was necessary
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">« 189 »</a></span>
to open the abdominal cavity for three inches and reach into
the abdomen with the fingers to draw up the peritoneum, and
all done with perfect success. Amputations of the fingers and
toes are not uncommon, and amputation of the leg and fore-arm
have been successfully performed by its use.</p>

<p>External and internal urethrotomy and cleft palate are usually
performed by its aid. I have seen large stones removed from
the urethra in this way without any expression of pain from the
patient, he talking with the surgeon about the case while it was
in progress.</p>

<p>Dr. Corning, of New York, has devised a method by which
the local effect of the drug may be indefinitely prolonged. His
theory was that the drug was washed from the tissues of the
blood and its effects thus lost. To prevent this he applies
elastic ligatures around the part, between the injection and the
heart, about two or three minutes after the injection is made.
When the injection is on the body or face where the ligature
can not be used, he uses large rings to surround the part, so
arranged that firm pressure can be made upon them, and thus
cut off the active circulation. He claims for this that a weaker
solution can be used and the effects continued for a much longer
time.</p>

<p>The mode of proceeding is usually to inject from ten to fifty
drops of a 4 per cent. solution around the part to be operated
upon, using an ordinary hypodermic syringe. From three to
five drops of this solution are injected at short intervals in a
zone surrounding the part to be operated; or a larger
quantity is injected near the body of the nerve supplying
the part. If this is reached the anæsthesis is complete.
In two or three minutes the knife can be freely used,
and the patient feels no pain, although they look at the knife as
it divides the tissues. In the throat clinic a solution of cocaine
is used with an atomizer to allay the irritability of sensitive
parts, that a more thorough examination may be made. At
the eye clinic cocaine is used as a mydriatic, atropia being seldom
used for the purpose of examinations.</p>

<p>Patients usually dread the action of an anæsthetic; the
nausea, headache, and lassitude following its administration are
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">« 190 »</a></span>
things not pleasant to contemplate, but with this new drug
none of these are encountered.</p>

<p>The conclusions are, then, from our present experience, that
cocaine is a pleasant, safe and efficient local anæsthetic.</p>

<p class="caption3">BALTIMORE LETTER.</p>

<p>At the last meeting of one of the city medical societies one
of the members reported a case of typhoid fever in which the
pulse had remained quite low for over a week. Several questions
were asked concerning the <i>normal</i> pulse of the man. The
doctor insisted that he knew the normal pulse was higher, as he
had examined it many times in health. This was strange and
so many members plied the doctor with questions that he finally
confessed that the young man was a member of the family when
he (the doctor) was courting his (the doctor's, not the patient's)
wife. Of course the entire society understood at once that
the doctor felt the pulse of the entire family during this love-sickness.
There are many ways of courting&mdash;Josh Billings had a very
good way. Some fellows buy the old gentleman a cane (very
appropriate and often <i>useful</i>); the small brother a box of candy,
so that he will vacate the parlor&mdash;and for the baby sister a wax
doll with long flaxen hair&mdash;which she invariably informs the
neighborhood was given to her "by Sallie's beau."</p>

<p>We once knew a nice young man who had been told that the
best plan was to court the mother for a while. He heeded the
advice and was getting along very finely, when one day he received
an invitation to attend the marriage of his girl to the
fellow who had been courting <i>her</i> and not her <i>mother</i>.</p>

<p>This little occurrence turned our minds to the humorous
things of our experiences, and after adjournment of the society
a number of "funny" things were related as we walked homeward.</p>

<p>The following is interesting to the gynæcologists:</p>

<p>A young married woman (without children, or she would
have other things to require her attention) had been for some
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">« 191 »</a></span>
time afflicted with uterine trouble. She had been treated by
several physicians. Various pessaries had been worn. The
last attendant discovered that it mattered not what kind of
pessary was used, nor in what position it was placed in order
to afford satisfactory relief. Finally an abdominal supporter,
with cup and stem attachment was wanted and obtained. This
by far surpassed any other, until one day it "hurt a little."
The patient at once thought of an improvement. She removed
the cup and stem, detached the cup and reintroduced the stem.
It gave perfect satisfaction and has been worn with comfort for
about three months. We sincerely hope this simple instrument
will be able to permanently retain the displaced&mdash;mind&mdash;in
proper position. We offered it to the profession as the finest
instrument yet discovered for such cases. It is not patented,
no royalty is received by the discoverer, and no extra charge
is made for the thread on the internal end of the stem.</p>

<p>The medical colleges have resumed their regular lectures,
the students having returned from their Christmas visit to their&mdash;mothers.</p>

<p>One of the societies inaugurated the new year by a banquet,
which was a most delightful affair. It was given at the Eutaw
House, was well attended, substantial, and well served. The
toasts formed no small part of the enjoyment. Some of the
reminiscences of the older members afforded much merriment.</p>

<p>A very interesting case of the heart displaced to the left side
was exhibited to the Clinical Society by Dr. McSherry at the
meeting of January 8. It is rare, and only a few cases are
reported. Displacement to right side is not of unfrequent
occurrence, and a number of cases are recorded. The apex
beat in this case is heard two inches to the left of a perpendicular
line through the left nipple. The first line of dullness is one
inch and a half to the left of the center of the sternum. Attachment
to a contracted lung due to phthisis is the probable
cause of the displacement. At the same meeting there were
reported two cases of laparotomy for intestinal obstruction.
Both terminated in recovery.</p>

<p>A somewhat novel, but said to be successful, treatment for
cases of "wry neck" due to neuralgia or "cold" was mentioned
at the Medical and Surgical Society on the 14th. It is to sit
for one half hour or more near a very hot stove, placing the affected
side opposite an open door. A screen should be placed
beyond the patient so as to confine the heat as much as possible
to his immediate locality.</p>

<p>It was suggested by the mention of a case, in a child eleven
years old, which had continued four weeks, in spite of treatment.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">« 192 »</a></span>
One physician thought the Faradic current a specific
in such cases.</p>

<p>I have read with pleasure a little work which, if I mistake
not, will be most welcome to the profession. It is a book of
nearly seventy pages, entitled 'Practical Notes on the Treatment
of Skin Diseases.' I am glad to say also, that it is written
and published by a Baltimore physician, Professor Rohé,
whose 'Text Book of Hygiene' I took occasion to mention in
my last communication.</p>

<p>I suppose all country practitioners, if not those of the city also,
who are busy from morning till night with hardly two hours a
day for reading, have felt as I have on many occasions, the need
of some concise practical text books not given to speculations
and generalizations! Especially is this needed in "Skin Diseases,"
because of the meager knowledge that we common
practitioners have of the subject. There has seemed to me to be
a tendency to call most skin diseases "eczema," just as it undoubtedly
is to call all vague pains throughout the body "rheumatism."</p>

<p>Dr. Rohé very truly remarks that "most text books on dermatology
have as their besetting sins complicated classifications
or 'systems,' an awkward nomenclature, great prolixity and a
lack of definiteness in the description of typical diseases, and an
undue multiplication of morbid processes." No one better understands
this than a practical physician who has spent half an
hour hunting through one or two large text books for light on
a case in hand and finally "falls back on" his 'Dunglison.' It
seems quite clear that without a fine atlas most of the large
works on dermatology are for the most part unintelligible.</p>

<p>Dr. Rohé's book is one of a series, the others to follow
shortly if this is accorded a hearty reception. This first series
is devoted to the diseases of the perspiratory and sebaceous
glands. Their anatomy and physiology are briefly stated, then
follows the descriptions of the diseases commonly met with, as
well as the rarer forms, in terse, plain language. The last few
pages contain formulæ which experience has shown to be of
value. The subjects of "prickly heat" and "acne" are especially
well treated, and either of them is more than worth the
price of the book.</p>

<p>I have dwelt at much length on this subject because I feel
that this little work ought to be in the hands of every busy
practitioner who is not well acquainted with diseases of the
skin. It can be had by sending twenty-five (25) cents to the
author, Dr. George H. Rohé, 139 North Calvert street, Baltimore,
Md.</p>

contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
